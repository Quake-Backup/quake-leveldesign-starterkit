## Features

The current version of **QLDSK** includes the following set of tools and extras:

### Tools

* **ericw-tools**, Eric Wasylishen [[GitHub](https://github.com/ericwa/ericw-tools)] [[Website](https://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools)]
  - A suite of command-line utilities for building levels (maps) for games like Quake and Hexen 2, and represent an evolved branch of Tyrann's original Quake tools. The tools focus on adding advanced lighting features, some of which are borrowed from q3map2, and include bugfixes for the qbsp tool, which is used for constructing the block structure of the map.
* **Ironwail**, Andrei Drexler [[GitHub](https://github.com/andrei-drexler/ironwail)] [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrei_drexler)] 
  - An advanced fork of QuakeSpasm, a popular source port of the Quake engine, aimed at enhancing performance and introducing additional features. It has been optimized for high performance, incorporating modern techniques such as culling, GPU-accelerated lightmap updates, and compute shaders, allowing it to handle highly detailed Quake maps at very high framerates.
* **Quake CLI Tools**, Joshua Skelton [[GitHub](https://github.com/joshuaskelly/quake-cli-tools)] [[Website](https://joshua.itch.io/quake-tools)] [[Usage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ0RX62VYaA)]
  - A collection of command-line utilities to facilitate the creation of content for the Quake game series. These tools can perform various tasks, including managing PAK and WAD files, such as adding and extracting files, converting BSP files to WAD files, and even creating SVG files from BSP files.
* **TrenchBroom**, Kristian Duske [[GitHub](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom)] [[Website](http://kristianduske.com/trenchbroom)]
  - A free, open-source, cross-platform level editor designed explicitly for Quake-engine-based games. It is compatible with games like Quake, Quake 2, and Hexen 2 and can be run on multiple operating systems. It is recognized for its ease of use, offering simple and advanced tools that enable designers to craft complex and engaging levels without much hassle.

### Extras

* **Prototype WAD**, Aleksander Marhall [[Source](https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/prototype-wad.263)]
  - A resource containing Quake textures designed for map prototyping. It features 273 prototype textures that are indexed to Quake's palette. The collection includes basic checker textures in eight base colors, three shades, and four different sizes (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128). It also contains solid color textures, which include fullbright colors, and specialized textures.
* **TrenchBroom Quake Map Source**, Atul Varma [[Source](https://book.leveldesignbook.com/appendix/resources/quake)]
  - A collection of the original Quake 1 MAP source files, as released by John Romero in 2006. These files have been converted to a modern file format that is compatible with TrenchBroom. Additionally,  the texture references in these files have been fixed with a repackaged `quake101.wad` file.

## Project Structure

The organization of **QLDSK** is as follows:

```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extras/         # Contains third-party resource files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game/           # Houses the game engine and associated data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ level-editor/   # Stores the level editor's binaries
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/          # Holds the tool binaries
```

---

## Installation

### Software Requirements

* A legitimate copy of Quake [[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310)] [[Good Old Games](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_the_offering)]
* For **Microsoft Windows** users:
  - Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 [[x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)]

### Download

Get the [latest ZIP release](https://github.com/jonathanlinat/quake-leveldesign-starterkit/releases) and extract its contents into a directory, likely named `quake-leveldesign-starterkit-<date>-<os>`.

### First Setup

Find and open the `quake-leveldesign-starterkit-<date>-<os>` directory in your files explorer.

Create two new directories:

* An `id1` directory within the `game` directory.
* A `maps` directory inside the `id1` directory for saving compiled maps.
* A `working` directory at the root, which will remain empty until the `ericw-tools` compiler is utilized, and where the MAP and other related files will be hosted.

Lastly, from your original Quake game installation, copy the `pak0.pak` file into the `id1` directory. These files are necessary to test your map using `Ironwail`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: These instructions are also applicable to other expansions and modifications.

Here is what you should have at the end of the process:

```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extras/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ id1/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ maps/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pak0.pak
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ level-editor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ working/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Users on Unix systems need to grant execution rights to binaries.
>
> To set execution permissions recursively from the **QLDSK** directory, execute this command in your Terminal: `find . -type f -exec sh -c 'file -b "{}" | grep -q "^ELF"' \; -exec chmod +x "{}" \;`.
